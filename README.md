# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

These were some examples I worked on for practice, and a description below follows

## Classes

### Graph

This class implements depth-first search and breadth-first search for a weighted graph.

### HashTable

This class acts essentially like HashMap<R, S> for looking up data by key.

### Bucket

This is a helper for the hashing.

### Pair

This is also a helper class for the hashing, where a Pair<key, value> is used.

### Heap

This is for an implementation of Heap sort using a Comparator, and will re-heapify upon changing the Comparator
